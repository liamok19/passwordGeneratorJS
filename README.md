# passwordGeneratorJS

1. It's a good programming practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script.
2. If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated.
3. Objective. When the user clicks the "Generator button" an alert box pop up and asks the following: 
    1. Would you like Upper case for your PW?
        1. 'y' -True to determine all to be up case. 
        2. 'n' - False to determine all lower case. 
    2. How many numbers from 0-99 would you like to choose from.
    3. Would you like special symbols/characters for your PW?
        1. 'y' - yes and it will send you to another category box.
            1. y (true) is determined by the special characters added into the box. 
        2. 'n' - no (false) it will then move onto the next step.
4. Based on the user selection a password will need to generate a PW from 8-128 characters long based on the results above.
