# passwordGeneratorJS

* Key: PW = Password.

1. Declare variables at the beginning. Strings for each category. Numbers, Symbols, LowcaseLetters and UppercaseLetters. 
2. Objective: When the user clicks the "Generator button" an alert asks the following: 
    1. How many numbers from 8-128 would you like to choose from.
        1. Window alert. User must provide a value within this number range. 
        2. Window alert. User must provide a number with these constraints.
    2. Would you like Lower Case letters for your PW?
        1. 'ok' - True to push lowerCaseLetters to be part of the PW. 
        2. 'cancel' - False! 
    3. Would you like Upper Case letters for your PW?
        1. 'ok' - True to push upperCaseLetters to be part of the PW. 
        2. 'cancel' - False!   
    4. Would you like special symbols/specialcharacters for your PW?
        1. 'ok' - True to push symbols/specialcharacters to be part of the PW. 
        2. 'cancel' - False! 
    5. Would you like special numbers for your PW?
        1. 'ok' - True to push numbers to be part of the PW. 
        2. 'cancel' - False! 
3. Based on the user selection a password will need to be generated containing the categories been pushed and at the length the user chose (between 8-128).

## Strategy

1. Review the objective of the assignment and plan Computational Thinking. Decomposition, Pattern recognition, Abstraction and Algorithim. 
3. Create a repository first via github. Whilst including the new repo make sure that it's set to 'Public' and that you have the READme file attached. 
4. Git clone to your local server. 
5. Open the HTML, CSS and JS provided. Make sure that the CSS and JS are linking up with the HTML. 
6. JS to be at the bottom of the HTML body. Easier for browsert to load. 
2. Write out pseudo code for the operation. 
8. Go back to the goals that you have listed in Step 1 and work through them. 
9. Throughout the process continue to git commit messages of your updates and push to github. While you're pushing to github make sure your pushing the local folder so your work also versions up to github. 
10. Once the Generator PW site is looking like the objective set by the instructors deploy Github Link.
