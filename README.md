## Strategy

1. Review the objective of the assignment and plan Computational Thinking. Decomposition, Pattern recognition, Abstraction and Algorithim. 
3. Create a repository first via github. Whilst including the new repo make sure that it's set to 'Public' and that you have the READme file attached. 
4. Git clone to your local server. 
5. Open the HTML, CSS and JS provided. Make sure that the CSS and JS are linking up with the HTML. 
6. JS to be at the bottom of the HTML body. Easier for browsert to load. 
2. Write out pseudo code for the operation. 
8. Go back to the goals that you have listed in Step 1 and work through them. 
9. Throughout the process continue to git commit messages of your updates and push to github. While you're pushing to github make sure your pushing the local folder so your work also versions up to github. 
10. Once the Generator PW site is looking like the objective set by the instructors deploy Github Link.
